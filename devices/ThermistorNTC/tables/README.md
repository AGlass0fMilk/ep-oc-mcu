# ThermistorNTC Tables

This directory contains premade ValueMapping tables for NTC thermistors
that we have used in the past.

## Contributing

When contributing a premade lookup table, please provide the **exact** part number and preferably a reliable hyperlink to the part the table is for.

You may also place the device's datasheet (if reasonably small) in the **docs** subdirectory here.
